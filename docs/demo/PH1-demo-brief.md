# BrokerOps Phase 1 — Demo Brief

**One-liner:** Unified governance layer capturing LP order lifecycle across multiple MT5 servers with cryptographic audit trail.

---

## What It Proves Today

- **Multi-server visibility:** Orders from Server 1 and Server 2 appear in a single dashboard with clear origin tagging.
- **Tamper-evident audit:** Every event is hash-chained; evidence packs can be exported for regulatory review.
- **Rejection normalization:** LP-specific error codes mapped to standard reasons for cross-LP analytics.

---

## What Is Simulated Today

- **Order events:** Generated by lp-simulator, not live MT5 feeds.
- **Exposure aggregation:** Derived from simulated data; labeled "DEMO / Derived" in UI.
- **Policy scope selector:** UI control present but not enforced—demo placeholder for Phase 2.

---

## What Becomes Real in Phase 2

- **MT5 Manager API integration:** Live order events from your production/test servers.
- **Consolidated exposure ledger:** Real-time aggregated risk across all servers (requires Shadow Ledger validation).
- **Pre-trade policy enforcement:** Block or modify orders based on configurable guardrails.

## NOT IN SCOPE TODAY

| Capability | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Real multi-server enforcement | Requires MT5 adapter + policy engine wiring |
| Real consolidated exposure | Shadow Ledger must reconcile with MT5 positions |
| MT5 pre-trade blocking | Awaiting Manager API access |

---

## What We Need From You Next

1. **MT5 Manager API access** — credentials and endpoint for your test server.
2. **Phase 2 timeline confirmation** — target date to begin live integration.

_Truvesta holds decision authority; execution authority remains with your MT5 servers._
